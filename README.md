# go-datatable-search

The ability to search a table for data is the actual concept of DataTables. It allows the Users to easily access the data. This concept provides a way to control the global search of a table through the API. 

The global search is carried out across all searchable columns in orderÂ to disable searching for certain columns. If data is found matching in any column, then the whole row is matched and shown as the result set. 

This piece of code has been developed in Golang and anybody, who wishes to use this Go code for DataTable search can simply go with it.
